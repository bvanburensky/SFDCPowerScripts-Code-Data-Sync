# SFDCPowerScripts-Code-Data-Sync
Scripting for deployment of code and sync of Data specifically CPQ objects 
Having worked on so many CPQ projects, this is a real timesaver and bug killer. 
*New Revcloud will be added and some migration scripts as well
## These scripts are used to deploy packages between SFDC environments 
### Production, Sandox, scratch etc.  
### CPQ Scripts build to move all CPQ Objects from one to another in minutes 
### Requires external ids on all objects and i have added some tips on how to set it up.
### once in place you can stand up test envionments quickly and deploy back to prod intelligently
