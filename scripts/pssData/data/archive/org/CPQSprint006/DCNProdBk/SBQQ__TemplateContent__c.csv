	&#160;</li>

	&#160;</li>
	<li>Confidential Information. DCN Data shall at all times be treated as DCN Confidential Information by Customer pursuant to Section 10 of the MSA.<br />

<p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center"">&#160;</p>

<p>This Master Services Agreement (&#34;MSA&#34;), together with the provisions set forth in any MSA addendum, statement of work, order form attached to this MSA (collectively, the &#34;Agreement&#34;), governs all Services furnished by or on behalf of Dodge Construction Network LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, having a principal place of business at 300 American Metro Blvd., Suite 185, Hamilton, NJ 08619 and doing business as Dodge Construction Network (&#34;DCN&#34;) to the Party contracting for such Services and identified in the Agreement (the &#34;Customer&#34;). The Terms of Use are incorporated in and made a part of this MSA and the Agreement, provided that if there is any conflict among the terms or provisions of this MSA and the Terms of Use, the provisions of this MSA shall control. Customer and DCN are sometimes referred to in this MSA individually as a &#34;Party&#34; and collectively as the &#34;Parties.&#34;<br />
&#160;</p>

<p>Definitions. Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Appendix A to this MSA.</p>

<p>This MSA incorporates the attached Statement of Work (&#34;SOW&#34;), and all attached MSA Addenda. Together, this MSA, the SOW and the Addenda (if applicable) collectively set forth each Party&#39;s rights, duties and responsibilities. In event of a conflict between MSA and an Addendum, the Addendum controls. Collectively, the MSA, Addenda and SOW represent the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties as to the subject matter of the SOW and the Services described therein.</p>
&#160;

<ol>
	<li>Products &#38; Services - See SOW.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Fees and Charges - See SOW.<br />
	&#160;
	<p>a. Customer agrees to pay the Fees to DCN, together with any applicable taxes (other than taxes on DCN&#39;s income) promptly upon receipt of each invoice, and in no event later than thirty (30) days therefrom. DCN may increase or decrease the Fees at any time with or without prior notice, effective as of the next Renewal Term, if any. DCN may charge Customer one and one-half percent (1.5%) interest per month on all past due amounts.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>b. All Fees payable under the Agreement shall be non-refundable, except that DCN shall refund any Fees paid for future Services in the event Customer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 3(d), DCN terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(d)(iii), or DCN elects to refund any Fees pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.<br />
	&#160;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Term/Termination<br />
	&#160;
	<p>a. This Agreement shall become binding on Customer when Customer has returned a duly executed counterpart of this Agreement to DCN and Customer&#39;s account has been determined to be in good credit standing by DCN. DCN reserves the right to withhold granting of credit and may require prepayment, in whole or in part, for any or all Services.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>b. Services will commence as of the Effective Date, and shall continue for the Initial Term unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Services cannot be cancelled by Customer during the Initial Term, except pursuant to Section 3(d). If a Customer or an Affiliate does not elect to be manually renewed as specifically delineated in the Agreement, the Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive Renewal Terms, subject to credit approval, unless a written termination notice is provided by either Party at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>c. DCN may terminate the Agreement and/or cease delivery of one or more Services at any time, with or without notice to Customer, in the event of any material breach of the Agreement by Customer, any of Affiliate, any Authorized User or any agent thereof, as determined by DCN in its reasonable discretion. Failure to pay Fees when due shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement by Customer.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>d. Customer may terminate the Agreement in the event that DCN fails to materially deliver the Services on the schedule set forth in the SOW; provided however, that DC shall have the right to cure any default within thirty (30) days of a written notice of default by Customer that provides reasonable notice to DCN of the grounds for declaring the material default.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>e. Upon any termination of the Agreement, Customer shall immediately discontinue all use of the Services and shall destroy all copies of Software and Data (as defined in Addenda or SOW), including all copies, adaptations and merged portions thereof in any form, then in the possession or under the control of Customer, any Affiliate, any Authorized User or any agents thereof. Upon request, Customer shall certify such destruction to DCN.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>f. Sections 2, 3(e), 4 &#8211; 10 of this MSA, and any additional Sections so specified in related Addenda, shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<li>Ownership Rights As between DCN and Customer, all Data and Services are proprietary to and owned exclusively by DCN and/or its Licensors and are protected by applicable laws, including copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. DCN is the exclusive owner of all DCN Service Marks. Neither Customer, nor any Affiliate or Authorized User has any right, title, license or other interest in, to or under any Services or Service Marks, other than to the limited extent of the License expressly granted in an Addendum, and may not directly or indirectly use or display the DCN name or Service Marks without the express written consent of DCN, or as permitted in an Addendum. All rights not expressly granted to Customer in the Agreement are reserved exclusively to DCN and/or its Licensors. Customer shall take reasonable actions to protect the rights of DCN and its Licensors in and to DCN Data and Services.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Certain Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements of Customer<br />
	&#160;
	<p>a. This Agreement shall become binding on Customer when Customer has returned a duly executed counterpart of this Agreement to DCN and Customer&#39;s account has been determined to be in good credit standing by DCN. DCN reserves the right to withhold granting of credit and may require prepayment, in whole or in part, for any or all Services.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>b. DCN Digital Advertising Customer represents, warrants and covenants that it has the legal right to publish all images and text appearing in Customer advertisements appearing on DCN websites, including all required copyright and trademark permissions, and that at no time will Customer store, publish, or otherwise disseminate false, lewd, immoral, libelous or illegal material on any DCN website. To the extent that DCN downloads and publishes images posted on a Digital Advertising Customer&#39;s website or social media onto a DCN website for the benefit of the Digital Advertising Customer, the Digital Advertising Customer represents and warrants that it has all required copyright and trademark permissions for such images.

	&#160;</p>
	</li>
	<li>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES DCN and its Licensors do not represent, warrant or guarantee that the Services will be error-free, complete, accurate or uninterrupted. All Data and Services are provided &#34;AS IS,&#34; AND &#34;WHEN AVAILABLE.&#34; DCN AND ITS LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PERSON&#39;S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. NEITHER DCN NOR ITS LICENSORS REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY USE OF THE DATA OR SERVICES WILL BE USED OR USEFUL TO, OR MEET THE NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS OF, CUSTOMER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES. Customer assumes all risks of selection and use of the Data or Services, including that the Data or Services will be compatible with or usable in connection with the hardware, software or systems of Customer or any Affiliate.

	&#160;</p>

	<p>c.

	&#160;</p>

	<p>b. DCN shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer, its Affiliates and their respective directors, managers, officers, employees and agents (the &#34;Customer Indemnitees&#34;) from and against any and all Claims arising or resulting from or in connection with or relating to the infringement of a third Person&#39;s intellectual property rights as a result of the provision of the Data or Services by DCN pursuant to this Agreement, provided that Customer (i) promptly notifies DCN of such third Person Claim and permits DCN to assume the complete defense (including the unconditional right to settle or otherwise compromise such third Person Claim in its sole discretion) with counsel of DCN&#39;s choice and (ii) fully cooperates with DCN in such defense at the expense of DCN. Customer shall not settle or otherwise compromise any such third Person Claim without the express prior written consent of DCN. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DCN&#39;s indemnity pursuant to this Section 8(b) does not cover or relate to any Claim (i) that the use of the Services by Customer, any Affiliates or any Authorized User infringes the intellectual property rights of such third Person, or (ii) that any modification, change, amendment, customization, or adaptation of any Service not made by DCN, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third Person.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>c. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8(b), DCN shall not be liable for any infringement or alleged infringement that results from Customer&#39;s failure to implement corrections or changes to the Data or Services provided by DCN.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>d. If a Claim for infringement for which DCN may be obligated to indemnify Customer Indemnitees pursuant to Section 8(b) has been asserted, or in DCN&#39;s opinion is about or likely to be asserted, DCN may, at its option, either: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Data or Services; (ii) replace or modify the Data or Service so that it becomes non-infringing; (iii) terminate this Agreement and refund all pre-paid fees covering future use of the Data or Service; or (iv) defend the action on Customer&#39;s behalf pursuant to Section 8(b).<br />
	&#160;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Equitable Relief; Remedies not Exclusive Customer acknowledges and agrees that any breach of the Agreement may result in material damage to DCN that may not be measurable and would not adequately be compensated by monetary damages. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement by Customer, any Affiliate or any Authorized User, DCN shall be entitled to seek specific performance, preliminary and permanent injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief without posting any bond and without proving that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. The equitable remedies contemplated by this Section 9 shall not be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any and all other remedies to which DCN may be entitled under this Agreement, applicable law or otherwise, including the remedy of monetary damages. All such remedies shall be cumulative and not exclusive and the exercise by DCN of any one such remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any one or more other remedies.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Confidentiality<br />
	&#160;
	<p>a. Customer shall protect DCN Confidential Information with at least the degree of care with which it protects its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than reasonable care. Customer shall treat the terms of the Agreement as DCN Confidential Information.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>b. Customer (i) shall use DCN Confidential Information only in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement, and (ii) will not disclose DCN Confidential Information except to those employees, agents, contractors and Authorized Users who have first agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this MSA and who have a need to know such DCN Confidential Information in connection with the performance of Customer&#39;s obligations under the Agreement, and then only to the extent they need to know. Customer shall be responsible for any breach of this subsection by its employees, agents and contractors.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>c. This Section 10 shall not apply to any information that (i) Customer can demonstrate that it possessed prior to the Effective Date without obligation of confidentiality, as demonstrated by the records of Customer, (ii) Customer develops independently without use of any DCN Confidential Information, (iii) Customer rightfully receives from a third Person free to make such disclosure without breach of any legal obligation, or (iv) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of the Agreement.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>d. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10, Confidential Information may be disclosed by Customer pursuant to the lawful requirement or request of a governmental agency or as required by subpoena, court order or operation of law, provided that Customer (i) gives notice to DCN; (ii) makes a reasonable attempt in good faith to resist making such disclosure; and (iii) limits the amount and scope of the disclosure to the minimum necessary to comply with such requirement or request.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>e. Upon the request of DCN or upon the termination of the Agreement, Customer shall immediately turn over to DCN, or at the request of DCN, destroy and certify in writing as having been destroyed, all DCN Confidential Information that Customer has received, provided that the Customer may retain one copy of such DCN Confidential Information for its permanent files, or as required by applicable law, subject to the non-disclosure and non-use provisions of this Section 10.<br />

	&#160;
	<p>a.

Customer irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the City, County and State of New York for adjudicating all disputes and controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement, including the breach or alleged breach of the Agreement. Customer acknowledges and agrees that any such court is a convenient forum for the resolution of any such dispute or controversy and agrees not to assert in any forum that another forum is a convenient, or more convenient, forum for the resolution of such dispute or controversy.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>b. CUSTOMER HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY AMONG THE PARTIES, ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE. FURTHER, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM BROUGHT AS ANY TYPE OF CLASS, COORDINATED OR AGGREGATED SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING OR RECEIVE OR RETAIN, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AND HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY RIGHT TO RECEIVE OR RETAIN, ANY MONETARY OR OTHER BENEFIT AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.<br />

	<p>e. Neither DCN nor any Licensor is responsible or liable for events or circumstances beyond its reasonable control and shall not be responsible for or liable for any delay in performing or failure to perform under the Agreement to the extent that such delay or failure is a result of any cause beyond its reasonable control. Causes beyond DCN&#39;s or its Licensors&#39; reasonable control may include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God (such as fire, storm, earthquake, hurricanes, tornadoes and the like), electrical outages, labor disputes, wars, hostilities, revolutions, riots, civil commotion, national emergency, unavailability of supplies, plagues, epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of infectious disease or any other public health crisis (including related quarantines and employee restrictions), force of nature or explosion or any law, proclamation, regulation, ordinance or other acts or order of any court, government or governmental agency.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>f. The Agreement may only be modified, and a provision of the Agreement, or any breach of the Agreement, may only be waived, in a writing that expressly sets forth such modification or waiver and is signed by an authorized person of each Party. No waiver of any provision or breach of the Agreement is a continuing waiver. No delay in enforcing any right or remedy under the Agreement or available under applicable law, and no course of dealing by a Party or between the Parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right or remedy.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>g. Customer may not assign or transfer the Agreement or any rights under the Agreement without the express prior written consent of DCN, and any such assignment shall be null and void. DCN may assign the Agreement in connection with a merger, consolidation or other business combination to which it is a party or by which its ownership is affected or in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its business and assets. DCN may delegate the performance of all or any portion of the Services to a third Person.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>h. The provisions of the Agreement are severable. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of the Agreement is void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the court making such determination shall modify or otherwise reform such void or unenforceable provision by limiting the duration or scope, adding or deleting words or phrases or otherwise modifying such provision to effect the intent of the Parties to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>i. The headings of the Sections in the Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of the Agreement. Any reference in the Agreement to a &#34;Section&#34; or &#34;Sections&#34; means a Section of the Agreement. As used in the Agreement, the words &#34;including&#34; and &#34;includes&#34; shall be read and mean &#34;including, without limitation,&#34; or &#34;includes, without limitation,&#34; as the case may be, whether or not so expressed.

	&#160;</p>

	<p>j. The Parties have been represented by counsel, or have been given the opportunity to be represented by counsel, in the preparation and execution of the Agreement and it expresses the mutual intent of the Parties. If any provision of the Agreement is deemed to be ambiguous, such provision shall be enforced in accordance with the intent of the Parties and shall not be construed against a Party because such Party or its representative drafted such provision, nor shall any other principle of &#34;strict construction&#34; apply to the interpretation or enforcement of any provision of the Agreement.<br />
	&#160;</p>

	<p>k. In the event of a breach of the Agreement by Customer, an Affiliate or an Authorized User, DCN shall be entitled to recover from Customer all reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and disbursements and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses DCN incurs in connection with enforcing the Agreement.<br />

<p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center"">&#160;</p>

<ol>
	<li>This Master Services Agreement (&#34;MSA&#34;) governs all Services (as defined in Section 1 of this MSA) purchased by you (the &#34;Customer&#34;) from IMS (&#34;IMS&#34;), an affiliate of Dodge Construction Network, LLC. Customer and IMS are sometimes in this Agreement referred to individually as a &#34;Party&#34; and collectively as the &#34;Parties.&#34;<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Products &#38; Services IMS will use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish the reports, products, data, software, advertising, printing and/or other services selected by Customer (&#34;Services&#34;). The Services will be furnished by or on behalf of IMS and/or its licensors, vendors and suppliers (&#34;Licensors&#34;). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IMS hereby grants Customer, acting solely by and through its designated seat licensees identified in the Specifications above (&#34;Authorized Users&#34;), a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for the term of this Agreement in the United States to permit Authorized Users to access and use (i) the object code version of the software and related documentation (&#34;Software&#34;) and/or (ii) the information, data, documents, plans, specifications and addenda (if any) included as part of the Services (collectively, &#34;Data&#34;), solely for the internal business purposes of Customer. The Customer shall be fully responsible for the actions of Authorized Users and for any breach of this Agreement by any Authorized User. The Customer shall not represent itself as any other party or otherwise provide any false or misleading information. No portion of the Services may be: (i) sold, licensed or sub-licensed, or re-published outside of the Company without IMS&#39; prior written consent, which consent IMS may provide or withhold in its sole discretion; or (ii) used in any manner that competes with IMS and/or the Services. IMS reserves the right to monitor the use of the Services by Customer and Authorized Users in order to determine compliance with this Agreement. IMS may modify, add to or delete the Services or portions thereof, or change the media or the format of the Services, at any time in its sole discretion without liability to Customer, any Authorized Users and/or any other Person. To the extent commercially practicable, IMS will provide Customer with notice of any material change in the Services. Upon using Services after receipt of notice of any modification, addition or deletion, Customer shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed thereto, provided that if a modification, addition or deletion substantially and adversely affects the functionality of the Services for Customer, Customer may within seven (7) days after receipt of such notice terminate this Agreement.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Fees and Charges (a) Customer agrees to pay IMS&#39; fees for the Services, plus any applicable sales tax. IMS may increase or decrease the Fees at any time with prior notice, effective as of the next Renewal Term, if any. (b) If Customer elects to pay for the Services by credit card, Customer hereby authorizes IMS to charge Customer&#39;s credit card for the amount of the Fees set forth in each invoice, plus applicable sales tax. IMS will send the Customer an acknowledgement of any charges to the Customer&#39;s credit card account. (c) All Fees payable under this Agreement shall be non-refundable, except that IMS shall refund any Fees paid for future Services in the event Customer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Termination This Agreement shall become binding on Customer when Customer has returned a duly executed counterpart of this Agreement to IMS and its account has been determined to be in good credit standing by IMS. IMS reserves the right to withhold granting of credit and may require prepayment, in whole or in part, for any or all Services. Failure to pay Fees when due shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement by Customer. Sections 2 and 3 through 8 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. No termination notice to IMS shall be effective unless it is in writing and provides not less than thirty (30) days&#39; notice prior to the next renewal term.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li>Ownership Rights As between IMS and Customer, all Services are proprietary to and owned exclusively by IMS and/or its Licensors and are protected by applicable laws, including copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Neither Customer nor any Authorized User has any right, title, license of other interest in, to or under any of the foregoing, other than the License. All rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement are reserved exclusively to IMS and/or its Licensors. Customer shall take reasonable actions to protect the rights of IMS and its Licensors in the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, any reference in this Section 5 to the Services includes all Software, Data and other deliverables included therein.<br />
